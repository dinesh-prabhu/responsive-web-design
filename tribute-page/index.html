                <p>Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March
                    1879.<br><br>
                    Einstein excelled at math and physics from a young age, taught himself algebra and Euclidean
                    geometry
                    over a single summer and mastered calculus at the age of 14.</p>

                <p>As a physicist, Einstein had many discoveries, but he is perhaps best known for his theory of
                    relativity
                    and the equation <i>E=mc<sup>2</sup></i>.<br><br>
                    The theory of relativity usually encompasses two interrelated theories, special relativity and
                    general
                    relativity, proposed and published in 1905 and 1915, respectively.</p>

                <h3>Special relativity</h4>
                    <p>Special relativity applies to all physical phenomena in the absence of gravity and is a theory of
                        the
                        structure of spacetime. This theory has many surprising and counterintuitive consequences such
                        as Time
                        dilation, Length contraction etc.</p>
                    <h3>General relativity</h4>
                        <p>The development of general relativity began with the equivalence principle, under which the
                            states of
                            accelerated motion and being at rest in a gravitational field are physically identical. Some
                            of the
                            consequences of general relativity are Gravitational time dilation, Frame-dragging etc.</p>
                        <h3>Mass–energy equivalence</h3>
                        <p>In relativity, all the energy that moves with an object (i.e., the energy as measured in the
                            object's
                            rest frame) contributes to the total mass of the body, which measures how much it resists
                            acceleration.
                            Mass contributed to an object by the energy can be calculated using
                            <i>m=E/c<sup>2</sup></i>.
