                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and
                        its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to
                        place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and
                        page navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate
                        with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
                        application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
            <header>Hello world</header>
            <article>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                    JavaScript code:</p>
                <code class="code-block">function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                    greetMe("World");</code>
                <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                    characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as Ã¥ and Ã¼ in identifiers. You can also use the
                    Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits,
                    temp99, and _name.</p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header>Constants</header>
            <article>
                <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant
                    identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or
                    dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
                <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It
                    has to be initialized to a value.</p>
                <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const
                    keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
                <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For
                    example:</p>
                <code class="code-block">// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                    CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                    }
                </code>
                <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without
                    problems.</p>
                <code class="code-block">const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
                </code>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
            <header>while statement</header>
            <article>
                <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while
                    statement looks as follows:</p>
                <code class="code-block">while (condition) statement</code>
                <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
                    statement following the loop.</p>
                <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true,
                    statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
                    stops and control is passed to the statement following while.</p>
                <p>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.</p>
                <p>Example:<br>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
                <code class="code-block">var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
                <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the
                    following values:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                    <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                    <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
            <header>Function declarations</header>
            <article>
                <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the
                    function keyword, followed by:
                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the function.</li>
                    <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                    <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
                <code class="code-block">function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
                <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that
                    says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
                    statement specifies the value returned by the function.</p>
                <code class="code-block">return number * number;</code>
                <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the
                    function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
                    globally or in the calling function.</p>
